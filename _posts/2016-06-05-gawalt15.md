title: Deploying high throughput predictive models with the actor framework
abstract: 'The majority of data science and machine learning tutorials focus on generating
  models: assembling a dataset; splitting the data into training, validation, and
  testing subsets; building the model; and demonstrating its generalizability. But
  when itâ€™s time to repeat the analogous steps when using the model in production,
  issues of high latency or low throughput can arise. To an end user, the cost of
  too much time spent featurizing raw data and evaluating a model over features can
  wind up erasing any gains a smarter prediction can offer. Exposing concurrency in
  these model-usage steps, and then capitalizing on that concurrency, can improve
  throughput. This paper describes how the actor framework can be used to bring a
  predictive model to a real-time setting. Two case-study examples are described:
  a live deployment built for the freelancing platform Upwork, a simple text classifier
  with accompanying code for use as an introductory project.'
